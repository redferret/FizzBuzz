# FizzBuzz
The classic number game Fizz Buzz

This is just a simple project to demonstrate test-first development.
Unit tests must be written first before the functionality is written. 
The unit tests support you, the coder, in building a program. The unit tests
act as a scaffold for your program.
ALWAYS Test-First
